Created J3 and J5 for Mock CCC 26 Contest hosted at WLMAC CI as part of MCPT (Mackenzie Competitive Programming Team).

I tried making it similar to typical questions on the real CCC with the difficulty being similar or a bit harder because participants work in teams.

Schools that joined include: William Lyon Mackenzie CI, Victoria Park CI,  Bloor CI, Woburn CI, Lawrence Park CI
